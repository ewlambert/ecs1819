        <p> <h1><center>Top 8 Places to Eat Out: by Sam Anthony</h1></center> 
Around Lane Tech there are a plenty of food options if you are going out for lunch or eating after school. Here are our top 8 restaurants to eat at by Lane:
<p></p>
<h4><center>8. Potbelly Sandwich Shop</center></h4>
Although a little pricey Potbelly offers a wide variety of sandwiches ranging from plain turkey to meatball sandwiches. They also have a breakfast menu, soups, and other types of snacks. The type of the food they sell is more healthy than a fast food place, but the style of the restaurant is not where they serve the food to you. It is a favorite of many students, Potbelly even offers shakes! 
<p></p>
<h4><center>7. Mariano’s</center></h4>
Mariano’s is our number 7 because they have an endless choice of food from salads to fried chicken. They offer a wide variety of foods at a good price. Being a grocery store you should be able to find anything you need.
<p></p>
<h4><center>6. Chipotle Mexican Grill</center></h4>
Chipotle is a Mexican restaurant with burritos, tacos, salads and bowls. They make your order right in front of you with fresh ingredients. This is our number 6 because it is a student favorite and has many great foods, although it might be expensive.
<p></p>
<h4><center>5. Meatheads</center></h4> 
The main thing on their menu is burgers and they try to focus their menu to be fresh and healthy. They have turkey burgers as an alternative to beef burgers. The location of the meatheads is south of Lane on western and is next to the Chipotle. The style of this restaurant is a sitting place and they bring you the food. The service is not extremely fast when the place is crowded, but the food is very good that is why we think that it is the 5th best.  
<p></p>
<h4><center>4.Wingstop</center></h4>
Wingstop is a restaurant that offers over 10 flavors of wings for good prices. Their most commonly bought meal is the 5 dollar lunch combo that comes with wings, fries, and a drink.
<p></p>
<h4><center>3. McDonald's</center></h4>
McDonald's is, it is our number three because of its super affordable prices for decent food. For this reason, McDonald's is a favorite of many students to hang out at lunch or after school.
<p></p>
<h4><center>2. Mod Pizza</center></h4>
Mod’s Pizza is our number 4 because of its reasonable prices and good prices. One of the main thing they focus on is getting the food ready fast, so this is great for student who only have a limited time to eat at lunch. It’s just across the street Mod’s is sure to please your hungry stomach.
<p></p>
<h4><center>1. Wendy’s</center></h4>
The favorite of many students, Wendy’s offers burgers, chicken fingers, fries, and frosty a frozen milk/ice cream in a cup. Overall Wendy’s has solid food and good prices which landed it in our number one spot.
