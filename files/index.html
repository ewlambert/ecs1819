              <p><b>Advice - by Phillip Nguyen</b></p>
<p>
	Congratulations and welcome to all incoming freshman of Lane Technical High School, the school of champions. As all of you prepare for the next step of your educational career, the community of Lane is here to guide you all the way through 4 years. High School will most likely be a new experience to many of you and you may be overwhelmed by every new opportunity and things waiting for you as you come in. With High School being a major step, it’ll be beneficial to you and the community of Lane that you come into Lane as prepared as you can be. Below we have frequently asked questions many freshmen have as they are getting ready to become a high schooler.</p>

<p><b>How do I navigate around Lane Tech? -by Phillip Nguyen</b></p>

<p>Probably one of the most frequently asked questions from all incoming freshmen. With Lane Tech covering over 33 acres of land, Lane Technical High School is one of largest schools in the CPS system which can be very overwhelming for many freshmen coming in as they fear that they will not make it in time to their classes. The best advice the community of Lane can give to you is to create routes for your classes and make sure to follow them throughout the first few weeks unless a new, faster route pops out. Making routes to your classes can really help you during your first few weeks at Lane. If you get lost while following your route remember that all the odd numbered classes are on the western half of the building and all the even numbers are on the eastern half of the buildings. If you’re still lost don’t be shy to ask fellow upperclassmen as they were in your shoes not too long ago or a Lane Tech Staff member as they would be glad to help you. Don't worry about being late to your classes as the first few weeks all your tardies will not be marked or will be waived.</p>

<p><b>Lane Tech Tutoring - by Michael Baker</b></p>

<p>Students at Lane Tech are very fortunate in that the school offers many options for students who are struggling in any of their classes or just looking to further their knowledge of the topic. The school offers tutoring in the library for a large range of courses after school on Monday through Thursday. There are some exceptions such as the AP courses which usually have tutoring on Saturdays before the final. Some courses such as Math and English offer to tutor before school for students who are unable to attend after school tutoring. Many teachers may offer some form of separate tutoring in their own room both before and after school so don’t be afraid to ask your teachers about tutoring. To conclude Lane Tech as many tutoring opportunities both before and after school such as our library tutoring so make sure you seek out further help if you need it.</p>

<p><b>Time Management - by Phillip Nguyen</b></p>

<p></p>Incoming freshmen, do you ever feel like you never have enough time to do your school work or time to hang out and relax, well you’re not alone and it isn't gonna get easier from here. At Lane, the staff and teachers want to make sure you succeed after graduating. They may challenge you but they are not year here to take what's most precious to you, which is time. They know how much time is important to you as they too wish they had more time to spend. Advice we give to freshmen is that to plan out everything for the school day or whole day. By everything we mean what is necessary for you to accomplish here at Lane which can be by setting a time for when you should do what homework or study at what time. Make sure that you set a limit for everything you plan out because minutes can be precious.</p>

<p><b>Well-being and How to Handle Stress - by Phillip Nguyen</b></p>

<p>High school can be overwhelming to many freshmen as it is a new step in your life. Here at Lane we know stress can be damaging to your mental and physical health. Learning how to handle stress can help a lot in your high school times. Here at Lane we have our very own psychologist who can give you personal advice on dealing with stress. The most general advice we can give to incoming freshmen is take breaks between workloads, sleep well (we recommend 7-8 hours a day) and eat well. There are many factors to causing stress and finding out what causes can really help reduce your stress levels.
