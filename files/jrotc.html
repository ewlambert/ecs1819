        <h1><center>JROTC By Claudia Jimenez</center></h1>
        <p><b></b>
	Army JROTC, or Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, is a program promoted by the U.S. Armed Forces with the mission “to motivate young people to be better citizens.” JROTC is not meant to recruit young people for the military and is offered to high school students all four years. The curriculum of JROTC involves lessons in the classroom taught by military instructors and meeting in company (with cadets in the same class period) for announcements, drill, uniform inspection, and PT (physical training).
	Lane Tech offers U.S. Army JROTC, and all cadets at Lane are in the unit called Warrior Battalion. Leadership in JROTC follows the Chain of Command, which includes cadet commanders and high-ranking cadets in charge of the entire battalion, teams, and companies. Cadets can also apply to be on the City Corps Staff, which organizes events for all the JROTC programs in Chicago. Participating in City Corps is highly selective and is a prestigious honor.
	JROTC also includes several different teams and activities. Color Guard, Raiders Challenge, Archery, Drumline, LET I Drill, Upperclassmen Drill, Orienteering, Sports Challenge, JLAB, and Honor Guard are all cadet-led, help cadets improve their skills in anything from physical fitness to land navigation, and even compete against other schools.</p>
<h1><center>Tips For Being a Cadet</center></h1>
<p>
Always show respect for your superiors, especially your cadres and company and battalion CoC. They have worked very hard to be where they are now and work even harder for their cadets. 
Join teams!!! Being a part of a JROTC team is a unique experience, particularly because we have unique teams that are not offered to other students. You become very close with your teammates and you support each other through the highs and lows of preparing for and going to competition. Joining teams also makes JROTC so much fun and helps you make more friends.
Be ready for early morning and staying after school. Several teams meet at 6:45 a.m. or 3:30 p.m. Mandatory battalion formations and intrabattalion competitions are usually in the morning as well.
Make sure to take care of your uniform! Keep everything shiny and polished. Brasso works well for all the brass parts, including buttons and torches on your jacket and the insignia on your beret. Also, to keep your drill shoes clean and shiny, spray them with Pledge cleaner then wipe them with a tissue or smooth towel.  
Know your Chain of Command! This is very important since it’s part of your inspection grade, helps you know who to talk to if you have a specific concern, and shows respect for your superiors.
Be ready for PT on Fridays. Also be aware you may have to give your superior “2-5” (25 pushups) if you act out or show disrespect. 
Go to details when it’s your company’s month to do them. You could put the American flag up in the morning and down at the end of the school day, play “Go Lane Go” on the PA, or help clean the basement. Details are important but they’re also fun and help you spend time with the other cadets in your company.
JROTC is an amazing opportunity that can and will change your life for the better. Your experience in JROTC depends on you, though. Join teams, meet other cadets, go to competitions, and make the most of your time as a cadet. A loving family is waiting for you.
